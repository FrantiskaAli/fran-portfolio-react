Main aim of this homework however was practise of AJAX calls with jQuery and working with serversite API OpenWeather and Moments.js. That I managed to do without any trouble. Dashboard lets you find city and gives you weather for the day aswell as 5 days forecast. Local storage is used and cities searched are dynamically generated to stay after revisitng the site",
